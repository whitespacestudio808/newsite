							<div class="question">
								<p class="q">how does the process start?</p>
								<p class="answer">
									Please fill out the <a href="#project-request">contact form</a> at the bottom of the page, 
									then you'll receive an email from us with an invitation to chat more about how our custom 
									package can help your brand or business.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="question">
								<p class="q">what does "custom" mean?</p>
								<p class="answer">
									In this service we are creating a completely custom website - exclusively just for you. 
									Compared to the restyle package, where we customize a website template from our shop, your 
									website's layout and design will be to your specifications and like no other website out 
									there. If you have more specific questions regarding this, shoot us an email at 
									<a href="mailto:hello@white-space.studio">hello@white-space.studio</a>.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="question">
								<p class="q">how many web pages does this include?</p>
								<p class="answer">
									We create up to 6 pages. This usually includes the home page, blog page and 4 other pages. 
									More pages are are totally do-able but are an additional fee. We’ll talk about this when 
									we talk about Add Ons for your site.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="question">
								<p class="q">is a logo included in this package?</p>
								<p class="answer">
									YES! A simple &amp; modern logo is designed as a gift to our clients so that they will have 
									a full service professional finished product. If you already have a logo or you don't want 
									us to refine it, then we will spend that time working more extensively on the design of your 
									site. If you do require a logo completely designed to your specs and desires, we can talk 
									about that when we talk about Add Ons for your site.
								</p>
							</div>

						<div class="no-padding">
							<div class="question">
								<p class="q">what platforms do you offer?</p>
								<p class="answer">
									Right now we are focussed on Squarespace templates, because we love how versatile yet easy 
									to master this platform has become. But, we are already busy adding more templates to the 
									mix with soon to be launching Wordpress and Shopify themes. If you are interested in a 
									different platform now, contact us and we can chat about creating one exclusively for you.
