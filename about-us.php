							Your online presence is more than a showpony. It’s the workhorse behind your brand - 
							and whilst workhorses deserve to look stunning (Unicorns anyone?!), stunning doesn't 
							need to be a time-consuming, labor-intensive chore. 
							</p>
							<p>
							We've got all that heavy lifting covered. All you need to do is pick your favorite 
							template, and the platform you want to see it on, so our brilliant team of creative 
							minds (that's us) can bring their best to your project. We've got the chops to make 
							your website look amazing and convert customers on any (and every) device, so you can 
							stop stressing and get back to focusing on the business you love. And less of the 
							things you don't. 
							</p>

							We're not the kind of web designers that work out of their mom's basement, and there's 
							no meet-cute behind our founder’s introduction. Like most good ideas, we began with 
							coffee in hand and enough ideas to blow even Mark Zuckerberg out of the water.
							</p>
							<p>
							White Space Studio broke ground at a local coffee shop in Hawaii (shout out our beloved 
							Blue Tree Cafe!), who’s fun and edgy interior (well and their constant caffein supply) 
							help shaped the business we are today. From day 1, we’ve brought thoughtful design and 
							meaningful connection together for our clients to tell their stories. Ready to see, how 
							will we tell yours?

								<h2>judith</h2>
								<br>
								What do you get when you combine a dash of minimalist sensibility, a hint of ruthless efficiency, and a ton of marketing expertise? Our very own co-founder and creatvie director, Judith. As the creative force behind White Space, she brings the vision to any brand that comes her way. After graduating with a Masters in Business, she took Europe by storm and worked with global brands, like LEGO, across across Germany, Ireland, England, and Italy.

								<h2>marlon</h2>
								<br>
								Marlon, co-founder and resident tech genius behind White Space, handwrites code for fun. With pen and paper. Yeah, seriously. His other idea of fun? Creating more than 200 websites over the past decade. As an MIS graduate from UH Manoa, Marlon brings the backend of coding to the forefront of beautifully executed websites. With a can of Red Bull by his side and flip-flops on his feet, there’s almost nothing Marlon can’t conquer. Waves, mountains, and HTML are no match for this Hawaiian web designer.

								<h2>the team</h2>
								<br>
								The White Space Studio would just be a lot of…well, white space without the team behind it. Each one of us is a brain, and an athlete… wait, no. That’s The Breakfast Club. What we really are is a group of passionate creative thinkers and entrepreneurs that live on Asana. Some of us code, some of us are graphic designers. There’s a copywriter and a photographer, too. What we lack in geographic proximity (hello, remote working!) we make up for in good design, big ideas, and bold execution.
