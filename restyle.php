						<div class="no-padding">
							<div class="question">
								<p class="q">how does the process start?</p>
								<p class="answer">
									Please fill out the <a href="#project-request">contact form</a> at the bottom of the page, then you'll 
									receive an email from us with an invitation to chat more about how our 
									restyle package can help your brand or business.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="question">
								<p class="q">what does "template restyle" mean?</p>
								<p class="answer">
									We customize the colors, graphics, fonts, images and create a logo for you. The one element that will 
									stay consistent to the template is the layout. So, be sure to choose a layout that ya dig! If you would 
									like a completely custom website, you will need to go with our <a href="./custom">Custom Service</a>. If 
									you have more specific questions regarding this, shoot us an email at 
									<a href="mailto:hello@white-space.studio">hello@white-space.studio</a>.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="question">
								<p class="q">how many web pages does this include?</p>
								<p class="answer">
									We restyle up to 6 pages. This typically includes the home page, blog page and 4 other pages. More pages 
									are totally do-able but are an additional fee. We’ll talk about this when we talk about Add Ons for your 
									site.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="question">
								<p class="q">is a logo included in this package?</p>
								<p class="answer">
									YES! A simple &amp; modern logo is designed as a gift to our clients so that they will have a full service 
									professional finished product. If you already have a logo or you don't want us to refine it, then we will 
									spend that time working more extensively on the design of your site. If you do require a logo completely 
									designed to your specs and desires, we can talk about that when we talk about Add Ons for your site.
								</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="no-padding">
							<div class="question">
								<p class="q">what platforms do you offer?</p>
								<p class="answer">
									Right now we are focussed on Squarespace templates, because we love how versatile yet easy to master this 
									platform has become. But, we are already busy adding more templates to the mix with soon to be launching 
									Wordpress and Shopify themes. If you are interested in a different platform now, contact us and we can chat 
									about creating one exclusively for you.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="question">
								<p class="q">do i need to pay anything upfront?</p>
								<p class="answer">
									Yes, a 50% down-payment is due just before the project starts. We book a number of clients who are looking 
									to get their website set up. The down-payment reserves your time slot, which means we do not book anyone else 
									and that time is dedicated fully to you and your website. The remainder of the project fee is due on the day 
									you want us to release your website into the world.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="question">
								<p class="q">what do i need to have ready before we start?</p>
								<p class="answer">
									We need all of your content before we can start the project (images, website copy, etc). We'll guide you 
									through the steps of our Brand Assignment that needs to be completed before your project kicks off.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="question">
								<p class="q">what will the finished product include?</p>
								<p class="answer">
									You get a finalized logo and branding elements. Fully implemented and launched custom website, a one-hour 
									briefing of how to update your website and the release of all graphic files.
