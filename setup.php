						<div class="no-padding">
							<div class="question">
								<p class="q">how does the process start?</p>
								<p class="answer">
									Please fill out the <a href="#project-request">contact form</a> at the bottom of the page, then you'll 
									receive an email from us with an invitation to chat more about how our 
									set-up package can help your brand or business.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="question">
								<p class="q">what does "template setup" mean?</p>
								<p class="answer">
									We take the template of your choice from our shop and implement it on the platform for you, following 
									the exact layout and style of the template. So, be sure to choose a layout that ya like! If you would 
									prefer a more personalized look to it or are after a completely custom website, you will need to go 
									with our fellow services of a <a href="./restyle">restyled</a> or <a href="./custom">custom</a> site. 
									If you have more specific questions regarding this, shoot us an email at 
									<a href="mailto:hello@white-space.studio">hello@white-space.studio</a>.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="question">
								<p class="q">how many web pages does this include?</p>
								<p class="answer">
									A setup includes up to 6 pages. This typically includes the home page, blog page and 4 other pages. 
									More pages are are totally do-able but are an additional fee. We’ll talk about this when we talk about 
									Add Ons for your site.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="question">
								<p class="q">is a logo included in this package?</p>
								<p class="answer">
									This package is mostly for anyone who already has a logo created and are now ready to give that branding 
									its virtual home. However if you are interested in a logo design, we would be super pleased to handle 
									that for you. This would be at an additional cost and we’ll talk about this when we talk about Add Ons 
									for your site.
								</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="no-padding">
							<div class="question">
								<p class="q">what platforms do you offer?</p>
								<p class="answer">
									Right now we are focussed on Squarespace templates, because we love how versatile yet easy to master this 
									platform has become. But, we are already busy adding more templates to the mix with soon to be launching 
									Wordpress and Shopify themes. If you are interested in a different platform now, contact us and we can 
									chat about creating one exclusively for you.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="question">
								<p class="q">do i need to pay anything upfront?</p>
								<p class="answer">
									Yes, full payment is due just before the project starts. We book a number of clients who are looking to 
									get their website set up. The full payment reserves your time slot, which means we do not book anyone else 
									and that time is dedicated fully to you and your website. 
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="question">
								<p class="q">what do i need to have ready before we start?</p>
								<p class="answer">
									We need all of your content before we can start the project (images, website copy, etc). We'll guide you 
									through the steps of our Brand Assignment that needs to be completed before your project kicks off.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="question">
								<p class="q">what will the finished product include?</p>
								<p class="answer">
									You will have a fully implemented and launched website, plus a virtual tour of how to update &amp; 
									maintain your website and the release of all graphic files. PS: If you also hired us to do your logo as 
									an ad-on, you get a finalized logo and all branding elements - ready to use for web and print.
